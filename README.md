#ΛVΛ

**ΛVΛ** (pronounced ay-va) is the ultimate alarm clock for those of you whose brains are just too good. If you have trouble waking up because you just can't stop snoozing your alarm, or especially if you get too used to your alarm time, **ΛVΛ** is for you.

**ΛVΛ** lets you set an interval between which you want your alarm to ring, but no option to set a definite alarm time – and that's just the point. **ΛVΛ** will set the alarm for a random time within the interval you set to ring at, so your alarm will always be at an unexpected time – therefore, you can wake up every time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Always in Flux

Using **ΛVΛ**, you'll always have an *idea* of when your alarm will ring, but never a definite time. With this, your brain can never get used to the time of the alarm and go right to snoozing it.

##Increase Your Chances

When the time of your alarm comes, **ΛVΛ** will ring up to 64 times before finally giving up. That's one alarm every three seconds – or a full 3.2 minutes of non-stop ringing per-alarm.

##Control – To An Extent

**ΛVΛ** allows you to set an interval of time between which your alarm should ring, which means that you can still be in some control of your alarm.
